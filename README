Argon Simulation

This directory contains the full workflow for a molecular dynamics simulation of bulk argon. The system was set up using a Lennard-Jones model and organized into four folders that follow the natural order of the simulation process. Each folder stores the files generated at its stage, making it easy to trace how the system evolves from the initial configuration to the final production trajectory.

initial
Contains the starting coordinate and topology files along with any force field information. This is the state of the system before minimization or equilibration.

1_em
Contains all outputs from the energy minimization step. The purpose of this phase is to remove bad contacts and relax the configuration before any dynamics are run. Typical files include the minimization log, energy file and minimized structure.

2_equil
Stores the outputs from both NVT and NPT equilibration runs. These steps stabilize temperature and pressure and allow the box size and system density to adjust before the production simulation. Logs, energies, checkpoints and equilibrated structures are stored here.

3_prod
Contains the files from the final production run. These include the main trajectory, final structure, energy files, logs and checkpoints. This is the dataset used for analysis of liquid argon behavior.
If the xtc trajectory file is not included, it can be generated by rerunning the final tpr file using GROMACS version apps/gromacs/2021.4.

For this version:

gmx mdrun -deffnm md

This will recreate md.xtc, md.trr and other standard output files.

If you are using a different GROMACS version, first generate a new tpr and then run mdrun.

gmx grompp -f mdp/md.mdp -c results/npt.gro -p input/topol.top -o md.tpr

gmx mdrun -deffnm md

How to Use

Review input/ for system setup files. Check mdp/ for parameter settings. Explore results/ for final structures, logs and regenerated trajectories. Add any new scripts to scripts/ if the workflow is extended.
